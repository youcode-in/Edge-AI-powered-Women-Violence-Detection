## Proposed Solution ##

### AI on the Edge ###

Edge AI is a system that uses Deep Learning algorithms to process data generated by a hardware device at the local level. The device does not need to be connected to the Internet to process such data and make decisions in real-time, in a matter of milliseconds. This considerably reduces the communication costs derived from the cloud model.
